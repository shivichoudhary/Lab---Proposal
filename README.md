# Lab---Proposal
contents and planning of my final project

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Make it make sense"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I plan on creating a madlibs generator that will prompt users to enter specific words and I will have a prewritten story code and tell them to enter an adjective or a noun or a verb something of that sort.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will contain more than one MadLib hopefully which will be seperated using def first_madlib and so on. It will ask the user for a certain random text and then it will generate my already prewritten text using text = f'' or any sort of variable that I may choose. I have not determined how to change the font yet but after some research I noticed I can use a font = (..) command to hopefully learn how to do that. This will be executed using various int(input()) requests and a more thoughtful outcome on how to get the text to sync up with the words being inputted. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Originally, I had wanted to combine this with my education and liberation abroad final in which I need to create a presentation about toxic school envrionments. I could easily code information about it to relate it back to both courses, but until I figure out a more creative manner to do so I don't think I will be pursuing that idea as it could be really boring for someone to just read information the whole time. This is a possibility however if my madlibs generator does not work out. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am working alone on this project

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish a base where people can enter words into a generator, no matter what the outcome may be I know I can create a base for the project

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-funny ending prompt
-the ability for the generator to catch a mistake if it says 'enter a noun' and they enter a verb or something along those lines

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I really want to figure out how I could possibly have more than one body of text to enter words into. In other words, I want them to enter it into one story but then I also want another story so almost like a loop one after the other. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I can definitely see myself acquiring skills that I was not comfortable with before such as altering the features of this program to be both accurate but also aesthetically pleasing. I think I will need to research how to change the font considering MadLibs always have a cool and funny presentation. I will need to become more comfrotable with prompting the user to do certain things and having them result in said outcome. I chose to work alone, not to avoid doing more work but because I want think project to be an accurate representation of what I have learned and splitting up work becomes tricky sometimes because of deciding who does what aspect then you both don't learn from it.
